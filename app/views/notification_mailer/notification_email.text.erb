You borrowed the following items from the <%= @shop %> some time ago:

<% @items.each do |item| %>
- <%= item.description %>
<% end %>

If you do not need the items anymore we would be happy to have them back soon.
Otherwise send us a short message why you need to keep the items longer.

Best,
<%= @shop %> Team
